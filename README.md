## The Origin
We were in a discord call looking for short domain names, when jack had the idea to make a max length domain. We spent a bit brainstorming names and trying to get one that was dead on the ICANN character limit and eventually settled on https://sowhydidibuyareallylongdomainjusttofindouthowlongadomaincouldbe.co.uk.
